### Key Adjustments:
- The project is specified as a **Social Media Application**.
- The API structure includes user registration, login, following/unfollowing users, notifications, posts, likes, and comments.
- **Authentication** is token-based for all sensitive operations, such as accessing profiles, liking posts, and interacting with notifications.
- Instructions and endpoints are tailored to a typical social media platform structure, where users can interact through posts, comments, and social connections (followers).
